## Installation

rscode_v1 requires [vscode IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) v1.75.1 to run.

Clone Git Tag by using the following syntax to clone a v3.0 tag:

```sh
git clone -b [tag_name] [repository_url]
git clone -b v1.0 https://github.com/giljr/rspass.git
```
The command clones tag v1.0 from the specified repository URL.

For development environments...

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ./manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
python ./manage.py createsuperuser
python ./manage.py runserver
```
You can now browse to the following link to start exploring the sample.
```sh
http://localhost:8000/
```


## Django Admin 
Also supports the **Django admin** which is available.
Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000/admin
```

#####  With virtualenv
We recommend and support the usage of virtualenv. All you need to do is create a new virtualenv (if necessary):


```sh
python -m venv ENV
```

And then just activate it:

```sh
source ENV/bin/activate
```
Import all the dependencies:
```sh
run pip freeze > requirements
```

Now you can go ahead with the instructions above.
